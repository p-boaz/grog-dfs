     - âœ… Files in `/lib/mlb/services/` directory
     - âœ… Key files in `/lib/mlb/dfs-analysis/` directory
     - âœ… Remaining files in `/lib/mlb/dfs-analysis/` directory completed
     - âœ… Environment-related files in `/lib/mlb/weather/weather.ts` and `/lib/mlb/game/*.ts`

2. **Streamline Type Definitions**

   - Normalize naming conventions
   - Improve type reuse through composition
   - Eliminate duplicate type definitions
   - Ensure consistent JSDoc comments for all types

3. **Documentation**

## Simplified Implementation Guide

1. **For each file needing updates:**

   - Identify local types that should be imported from central location
   - Import appropriate types from `/lib/mlb/types/`
   - Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify changes

2. **Import pattern:**

   ```typescript
   // BEFORE
   interface LocalType { ... }

   // AFTER
   import { CentralizedType } from "../types/domain/file";
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fixed import issues:**

   - When updating `pitcher-stats.ts`, found a missing cache TTL property (`matchup`). Replaced with existing `player` TTL.
   - Ensured types are properly re-exported through index files

2. **Type centralization benefits:**

   - Improved code consistency
   - Better documentation through standardized JSDoc comments
   - Easier to find and use types with properly organized structure
   - Reduced duplication across the codebase

3. **Adapting property names:**

   - Found that `BatterSeasonStats` used `rbis` while some files were using `rbi`
   - Important to check source types carefully for property names to avoid typechecking errors
   - Consider adding type adapters for legacy interfaces to ease migration

4. **Property subset challenges:**

   - Some modules throw type errors when switching to centralized types with fewer properties
   - May need to expand centralized types to include all needed properties or create more specialized types

5. **Leveraging existing types:**
   - Check for existing types in the centralized system before creating new ones
   - Prefer updating and expanding existing types rather than creating new duplicates
   - For related domains (like statcast), consolidate types in one file instead of scattering them

6. **Type composition approach:**
   - Using type composition (like `PitcherSeasonStats & { additionalProps }`) works well for extending centralized types
   - This approach maintains core type integrity while allowing for context-specific extensions
   - Type checking catches missing required properties which helps ensure implementations are complete

7. **Safe defaults for required properties:**
   - Adding `|| 0` for numeric properties ensures type safety when dealing with potentially undefined values
   - This is especially important for properties marked as required in the type definitions
   - For services that combine data from multiple sources, defaulting to safe values prevents runtime errors

8. **Managing return type extensions:**
   - Using intersection types (like `InningsProjection & { additionalProps }`) allows adding custom properties to standard interfaces
   - When modifying a function to use centralized types, it's important to carefully align all return values with the new type
   - Adding null checking (e.g., `pitcherMetrics?.property || defaultValue`) improves robustness with optional properties
   - Remember to update all error/fallback return paths when changing interface definitions

9. **Interface mismatches causing runtime issues:**
   - Discovered quality metrics weren't appearing in test results because necessary properties were missing
   - The issue: `BatterQualityMetrics` interface and calculation functions referenced advanced stats that weren't being calculated
   - Fixed by:
     1. Adding missing advanced stats fields (`babip`, `iso`, `hrRate`, `kRate`, `bbRate`, `sbRate`) to the `BatterSeasonStats` interface
     2. Implementing calculation logic for these advanced metrics in `transformBatterStats()`
     3. Resolving a mismatch between the `BatterQualityMetrics` interface and calculation functions
   - Lesson: Just declaring fields in interfaces isn't enough; implementation functions must properly calculate and populate those fields

10. **Resolving interface naming conflicts:**
   - Discovered an interface naming conflict between `batter.ts` and `events.ts` which both defined a `HitProjection` interface
   - This caused type errors when both were imported in the same file
   - Fixed by:
     1. Renaming one interface to `DetailedHitProjection` in `events.ts`
     2. Updating all references to the renamed interface
     3. Adding type assertions where necessary for cross-file compatibility
   - Lesson: When working with a large codebase, it's important to choose unique names for interfaces or use namespaces to avoid conflicts

11. **Adding new type interfaces improves organization:**
   - While updating the dfs-analysis files, we found opportunities to add new type interfaces:
     - For `run-production.ts`, we added RunProductionStats, CareerRunProductionProfile, TeamOffensiveContext, etc.
     - For `pitcher.ts`, we added PitcherHoldMetrics for stolen base analysis
     - For `plate-discipline.ts`, we leveraged BatterControlFactors and ControlMatchupData
   - These new interfaces help organize the code and provide better documentation

12. **Type composition benefits:**
   - Used type intersection (e.g., `StolenBaseAnalysis & StolenBaseProbabilityResult`) to combine standardized interfaces with module-specific additions
   - This approach preserves the original interfaces while adding custom properties needed by specific modules
   - Makes it easy to gradually migrate to the new type system while maintaining backward compatibility

13. **Duplicated types across the codebase:**
   - Found duplicate weather and game-related types defined in both `/lib/mlb/core/types.ts` and in dedicated type modules 
   - Resolved by updating imports to use the centralized types from their dedicated modules
   - Kept module-specific imports (e.g., GameFeedResponse) from the appropriate modules rather than using the main index export
   - This approach reduces the risk of importing conflicting types through different paths
