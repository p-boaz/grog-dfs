globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"]

---

- Edit only one file at a time so the user can easily review changes.
- For each file, provide all edits in a single, consolidated block.
- Do not ask for confirmation of things already provided in context.
- Do not ask the user to manually verify code that is visible in context.
- Do not suggest updates to a file unless actual changes are required.
- Preserve all unrelated or untouched code—do not modify it.
- When referencing files, use the real file path, not context-generated labels.
- Do not discuss the current implementation unless it’s necessary for the change or the user requests it.
- Always check the current context-generated file for accuracy before making edits.
