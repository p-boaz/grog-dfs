- Ensure all code is compatible with the specified framework or language versions in this project.
- If a version conflict arises, provide a backward-compatible solution or flag the issue clearly.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless strictly necessary.
- If a dependency is added, explain why and check if an existing one can serve the purpose.
