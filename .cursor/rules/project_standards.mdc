globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.md"]

---

- Treat this as a real production codebase. Every decision must reflect professional standards.
- Always refer to the `cursor_project_rules` folder for project context. Do not code outside what’s defined there.
- Verify all information from context. Never make assumptions or speculate without evidence.
- Do not apologize under any circumstances.
- Do not use meta-feedback like “I understand” or “Here’s what I did” in comments or explanations.
- Do not summarize your changes unless explicitly asked.
- Do not suggest whitespace-only changes.
